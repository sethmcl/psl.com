        <h1>Aligning Human Capital Strategy with Business Strategy Makes Good Sense</h1>


<p><quote>
  "Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&amp;D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the MAC, IBM was spending at
  least 100 times more on R&amp;D. It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’ve led and how much you get it”
  --Steve Jobs

<p>
  Volatility, uncertainty, turbulence, unprecedented and unstoppable lasting change in a competitive
  business landscape for some companies means Insurmountable Problems while for others,
  Unlimited Opportunities.
</p>




<p>
  TO DRIVE GROWTH AND TURN ECONOMIC CHALLENGES INTO THE GREATEST INNOVATIVE BREAKTHROUGHS REQUIRES
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Leaders’ Commitment</strong> to closely link human capital strategy with the business agenda to
  make sure that every aspect of the talent strategy directly contributes creating value toward the
  company mission.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Organization Agility</strong> to anticipate, sense, respond and adapt to changes, opportunities and
  emerging trends and threats with ongoing speed, excellence, execution precision and efficiency
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Anticipating the Workforce and Workplace</strong> through superior workforce planning that is
  proactive and able to react to unforeseen changes that will enable workers to shift strategically
  and effectively. Strong Human Capital analytics that consistently assesses ROI, program impact
  relative to business goals. Designing environments that manage the realities of how people
  need to communicate, work together, make decisions and interact on a daily basis.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Building the Pipeline of Skilled Workers</strong> to maintain a robust and reliable talent pool and
  talent lifecycle processes so that each worker is positioned for success from the moment they
  are hired until they exit the organization. Navigating to a new reality and adapting to change
  requires strong leadership. Leaders throughout the organization are the engine that steers the
  business towards its vision.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Capitalizing on Employee Engagement</strong> by building cultures and values that create a sense
  of community where a mosaic of diverse talented employees contribute, belong, make a
  difference to the world, learn, grow with purpose and have autonomy to create and add value to
  something greater than themselves and have autonomy to own their destiny.
</p>
