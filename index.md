<h1>Aligning Human Capital Strategy with Business Strategy Makes Good Sense</h1>

<quote>
  "Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the MAC, IBM was spending at
  least 100 times more on R&D. It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’ve led and how much you get it”
  --Steve Jobs
